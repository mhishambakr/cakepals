CakePals is an app where people can sell home-baked cakes and pies to each other. There are Bakers
who can register on CakePals and list their products for sale. App users typically look for available
offerings nearby, create a member account and place a baking order. Bakers receive orders,
bake and hand over ready products at the agreed collection time.
